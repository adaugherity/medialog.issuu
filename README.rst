Introduction
=============

This is a product to upload and manage files on issuu.com and use issuu.coms viewer within plone.
The following file types should work
"pdf", "odt", "doc", "wpd", "sxw", "sxi", "rtf", "odp" and "ppt"

You should add your issue id etc to the medialog control panel
(you get a free account at issuu.com ).
(it will work without doing this, but the files will then be store here: http://issuu.com/medialog.issuu/docs (for a limited time))

Thanks to Nathan van Gheem and for help and inspiration.
